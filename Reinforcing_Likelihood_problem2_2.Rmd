**Problem 2:		Question.		Is	a coin	fair?		You	sample	18	coin tosses	and	observe 10	heads. Compare	the	likelihood	function	for	p	in	the	following	two	cases: A	Bernoulli	process	that	results	in	c(0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1) and	a Binomial (k=10,n=18).**


**ii.	Plot	the	likelihood	functions	in	the	same	figure.**


```{r}
binomDist <- dbinom(10,18,seq(0,1, length,out = 19)) # length.out tells r the number of trails for p (1-19, or 18 trials)
print(binomDist)
binomDistNormal <- binomDist/max(binomDist) # normalize to 1

# create bernoulli likelihood
# this was my first attempt which is INCORRECT, but never figured out quite why
# this is incorrect because it doesn't produce a vector of products:
prod(dbinom(x=(c(0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1)),1, seq(0,1, length.out = 19), log=F))


#this is my second attempt:
#concatenate the results from flips into a variable
bernoulliX <- c(0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1) 

# this function is redudant because I couldn't incorporate theta as a sequenced variable, but this works
bernoulliFunc <- function(x) {
  p0 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0))
  p1 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.1))
  p2 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.2))
  p3 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.3))
  p4 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.4))
  p5 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.5))
  p6 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.6))
  p7 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.7))
  p8 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.8))
  p9 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,0.9))
  p10 <- prod(dbinom(x,1,1.0))
  return(c(p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8,p9,p10))
}

bernoulliDistNormal <- bernoulliFunc(bernoulliX)/max(bernoulliFunc(bernoulliX)) # normalize to 1

# plot both distributions on same figure
plot(seq(0,1, length.out=11), bernoulliDistNormal, main="Binomial (red) and Bernoulli (dots) Likelihood Functions", xlab="theta", ylab="likelihood")
lines(seq(0,1, length.out=19),binomDistNormal, col="red")
