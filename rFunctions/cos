### 'cos'
#### Peter Clark

One of the *Trig* functions, the **cos()** function computes the cosine value of numeric value. See Trig in help menu for a suite of other arguments
Note: R always works with angles in radians, not in degrees.

**Usage**

*cos(x)* where *x* is a numeric value, array or vector

```{r}
cos(120*pi/180) #  since R doesn't work in degrees, use pi/180 to calculate the cosine of an angle of 120 degrees 

x <- c(pi, pi/4, pi/3)
cos(x)
```
