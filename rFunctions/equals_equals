### '=='
#### Peter Clark

The logical vector **==** is a relational operator that compares values for exact equality. It can be used on atomic vectors and results in a binary output (e.g., True False). 

**Useage**

*x == y* compares two variabes for exact equality


```{r}
x1 <- 5 - 3
x2 <- 4 - 1
x1 == x2    # is x1 exactly equal to x2? No, so R returns FALSE

x1a <- 10-2
x2a <- 12-4
x1a == x2a # is x1A exactly equal to x2A? Yes, so R returns TRUE
```
