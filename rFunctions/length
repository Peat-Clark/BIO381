### 'length'
#### Peter Clark

The **length** function provides or allows you to set the length of an object (vector,lists) in the form of an integer. Note: If the parameter is a matrix or dataframe, it returns the number of variables (columns)

**Usage**

*length(x) returns* the length of a variable as an integer

*length(x) <- value* assigns the length of an object (vector, list), where "value" is a non-negative integer. Decimals (doubles) will be rounded down

```{r}

# assign the length of a vector of 10, trucating at xth component
x<-1:100
length(x) <- 10
x

# examine a vector is by returning its length (count)
x<-1:100
length(x)

# derive the length of two vectors to look at differences
z<-(1:30)
p<-(1:20)
length(z)-length(p)
```
