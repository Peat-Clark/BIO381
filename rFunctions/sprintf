### 'sprintf'
#### Peter Clark

This function allows for the creation of a character string that can be incoporated into a vector. It returns a character vector containing a formatted combination of text and variable values. While the paste function is more useful for vectors, **sprintf** is useful for precise control of the output. A wrapper for *c()* function

**Usage**

*sprintf(fmt, ...)* where fmt is a character string up to 8192 characters and ... are the values to be incorporated in the the fmt string

**Subuse**   

* To substitute in a string or string variable, use *%s*   
* For integers, use *%d* or a variant   
   * Many other options exist: For floating-point numbers, use *%f* for standard notation, and *%e* or *%E* for exponential notation. You can also use *%g* or *%G* for a "smart" formatter that automatically switches between the two formats, depending on where the significant digits are.

```{r}

x <- 2349
y <- 1111
z <- 2
sprintf("Substitute in a string or number: %s", x)   # %s substitutes x into the string
 
sprintf("Can have multiple %s %E occurrences %s", x, z, y, "- got it?")
```
