### 'tan'
#### Peter Clark


One of the *Trig* fucntions, the **tan()** function computes the tangent value of numeric value. See Trig in help menu for a suite of other arguments
Note: R always works with angles in radians, not in degrees. 

**Usage**

*tan(x)* where x is a numeric value, array or vector


```{r}
x <-pi
tan(x) # tangent value of pi

tan(pi) # or just enter the value you desire 

tan(120*pi/180) # to calculate the cosine of an angle of 120 degrees, you must use pi, since R doesn't work in degrees

x <- c(pi, pi/4, 0)
tan(x) # combine values to recive multiple computations at once
```
