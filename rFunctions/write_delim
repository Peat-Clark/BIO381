### 'write.delim'
#### Peter Clark

In package *"caroline"*, this function allows you to write a tab delimited text file. This is a wrapper for *write.table* with the same options as *read.delim*. Files are saved to your working directory.

**Usage**

*write.delim(df, file, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, sep = "\t", ...)*

**Arguments**   

* df:	   a dataframe.   
    * file	   outputfile path.   
      * quote    should elements of the dataframe be quoted for output.   
      * row.names   should the output include rownames.   
      * sep   the delimiter between fields.   
      * ...   other parameters passed to write.table.

```{r}
library(caroline) # run package caroline
x <- data.frame(a = I("a \" quote"), b = pi) # assigns dataframe to variable x
write.delim(x, file = "mydata.tab") # writes dataframe for x to tab delimited file saved to your working directory
```
